### Script

**Opening Sequence**

*Fade from black to a plain and uninspired average school corridor. Lockers cover the walls, making the place feel more crowded than it's necessary. The stench of puberty fills the air, suffocating the few oxygen molecules that barely make through the gaps left by the semi-opened windows, which overwatch the students from above the lockers. The pale light of the flickering fluorescent tubes gives everything a yellowish tone of unhealthiness. If all of this wasn't enough, the consistent chatter leaves no room to breathe.*
*It's no surpirse many call this place a prison*

*Among this amalgamation of people, a freckled tuft of red hair tries to make room for itself, not-so-ready to start this new day. After a bit of struggling, he finally reaches his locker. Someone was so kind to mark it down for him, with a big red "LOSER" writing, in case he ever found himself lost in these corridors. Truly a wonderful act of empathy from his fellow classmates.*

*He opens it with a loud screech that gets lost in the crowd, and starts unpacking his backpack from-*

[???]
> Hey!

*He jumps in fear and immediately covers his head with his arms, trying to protect his new-new pair of glasses. It's the third he changes this month.*

[NERD]
> Please don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me, pl-

[???]
> What? Why would I kill you?

*He slowly opens his eyes to reveal a black cluster of hair on top of a stack of loose clothes. Between the cluster, 2 small white dots staring at him.*

[NERD]
> Oh-h g-gosh, it-t's just you [F. GIRL]

*He sighs heavily, having lost another 3 or 4 years of his life. How much does he have left, he wonders.*

[F. GIRL]
> I know I'm not a bimbo-bitch like those cheerleaders, [NERD], but I'm not that ugly!

[NERD]
> Nononononononono I'm s-sorry [F. GIRL], that's not- I mean- I was saying-

[F. GIRL]
> Relax, I'm just kidding you.

*She looks around*

[F. GIRL]
> Have you got the stuff?

[NERD]
> Y-yes, it's all here, candles, flowers, rope, ...

*He rummages through the backpack listing everything he has prepared.*

[F. GIRL]
> Good good, I knew I could count on you. So, we meet up tonight, at the secret spot.
> [NERD] if you told someone, I swear-

[NERD]
> I haven't told a soul. Although, we need to bring back these thing's my mom is gonna notice...

[F. GIRL]
> I told you, it's fine, it's not gonna take long anyway I presume...

*She says as she smirks.*
*He blushes becoming now a freckled tomato, with a tuft of red hair on top.*

[NERD]
> H-hey, you n-never know! It's m-my first time anyway, better be cautios...

[F. GIRL]
> Relax. I'll see you tonight then. Don't be late [NERD]. I'm so excited

*Her eyes get brighter by the second as she leves the boy.*
*He sighs again, finishing going through his stuff. The bell rings as the locker gets closed, signalinig the start of a long, long day*

*Fade to black*

### Dialogue
**Opening Sequence**
*Later that day*
*Fade in to decrepit room. Half eaten, half moldy wooden boards form an unstable and creeky floor. The dust is so dense you can smell it, and its particle shines when hit by the flashlight. Calling the atmosphere "eerie" would be a severe understatment.*

*The two teenagers walk the allways of the abandoned building, beware of where they step. They reach a large room with a long dining table in it.*

[F. GIRL]
> Here, this is perfect.

[NERD]
> You want to do it here?

[F. GIRL]
> It's large enough but almost empty, so we don't accidentally hit some "sacred memorabilia" or some shit like that while we are in the process. It would ruin the mood.
> Come on, help me set up the place.

*He immediately takes off the equipment from his backpack. An assortment of the most disparate things gets throw on the floor, which would make anyone wonder "What the hell are they doing?".*

*She takes off from her coat a small agenda (or a diary perhaps), and starts going rapidly through the pages.* 

At this point they set up the scene for the ritual, something goes wrong ([NERD] hits something and all is ruined), so she gets trapped in a vortex, while he tries to save here.

[F. GIRL]
> HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...........

*She screams, and it's the last thing his ears capture.*
