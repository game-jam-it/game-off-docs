[[{"l":"Intro"},{"l":"Design","p":["The intent of this game’s design is to create a unique interesting take on a grid-based roguelike, by playing with the expectations of turns, also to create a unique aesthetic for horror-like media that doesn’t rely on jumpscares."]},{"l":"Audience","p":["There is an audience for retraux horror games, games such as World of Horror, and Faith, build an unsettling environment using the limits of their graphical presentation. Nostalgia of older style hardware and presentation is something that has a niche yet devout audience throughout the history of gaming, and I think that if we go the pixel art + Manual route, we can capture that audience."]},{"l":"Environment","p":["The game takes place in a fictional town within the United States. Most likely a small suburb with a school, some stores, a summer camp, and other amenities, perhaps it even has a few abandoned environments such as a sawmill, or dock.","On October 13 198X, A teenager broke into an abandoned house on a dare from their friends, while exploring, they find a forbidden text and read it, expecting nothing more than a way to pass the time.","Instead, all hell broke loose, many of the town’s inhabitants became possessed by demons, and some even became the willing servants of the devil, aiming to hunt down and kill the teen.","You play as this teenager, one of many slasher tropes, desperately seeking out the resources required to perform the counter ritual and set everything right again, it’s the only way you know you can make it out of this alive.","Also, the girl who you all thought would be the “Final Girl”? She’s nowhere to be seen."]}],[{"l":"Actors"},{"l":"Animations","p":["Because the game is played on a hexmap, all the movement and attack animations have to be setup to be executed in 4 directions. (2 mirrored for a total of 6 options) To stay with the overall look of the game the system uses 4-6 hand drawn frame per animations."]}],[{"l":"The Gang","p":["The Gang is a group of stereotyped teens that offer the player different play styles, events, and arcs.

The town is split up into three typical regions, an urban center, with suburb housing around it, and rural locations outside of those areas.","For every region, the town has multiple sectors/nodes for the player to explore.

The base textures also need 42 tiles to map all possible edges and transitions between types.
