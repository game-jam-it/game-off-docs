[[{"l":"A Game"},{"l":"Design","p":["The intent of this game’s design is to create a unique interesting take on a grid-based roguelike, by playing with the expectations of turns, also to create a unique aesthetic for horror-like media that doesn’t rely on jumpscares."]},{"l":"Audience","p":["There is an audience for retraux horror games, games such as World of Horror, and Faith, build an unsettling environment using the limits of their graphical presentation. Nostalgia of older style hardware and presentation is something that has a niche yet devout audience throughout the history of gaming, and I think that if we go the pixel art + Manual route, we can capture that audience."]},{"l":"Environment","p":["The game takes place in a fictional town within the United States. Most likely a small suburb with a school, some stores, a summer camp, and other amenities, perhaps it even has a few abandoned environments such as a sawmill, or dock.","On October 13 198X, A teenager broke into an abandoned house on a dare from their friends, while exploring, they find a forbidden text and read it, expecting nothing more than a way to pass the time.","Instead, all hell broke loose, many of the town’s inhabitants became possessed by demons, and some even became the willing servants of the devil, aiming to hunt down and kill the teen.","You play as this teenager, one of many slasher tropes, desperately seeking out the resources required to perform the counter ritual and set everything right again, it’s the only way you know you can make it out of this alive.","Also, the girl who you all thought would be the “Final Girl”? She’s nowhere to be seen."]}],[{"l":"The town"},{"l":"Intro","p":["The game takes place in a fictional town within the United States.

The town is split up into the three typical region, an urban center, with suburb housing around it, and rural locations outside of those areas.","For every region the town has multiple sectors/nodes for the player to explore. Most of these sctors are random nodes, while some are quest specific nodes that can be substantualy larger."]},{"l":"Events","p":["Most node on a town map are randomly selected out of a set of event for the region the node is in, while some of them are fully hand crafted others can have randomized elements in them. At the same time some nodes are just prperation nodes used to travel, stock up or learn info, others are expedition nodes where the player has to explore the sector to find items or defeat a specific threath.","Finaly some nodes have both, that may or may-not be available depending on the state of the game.","Based on the state of development the game has list of available events to pick from."]},{"l":"MVP Version","p":["Start in the Hounted House (Intro)","Next to the Cemitary (Tutorial)","The final Girl (End Boss)"]},{"l":"Demo Version","p":["Start in the Hounted House (Intro)","-> Outer","Next to the Cemitary (Tutorial)","-> Suburb","Pick your path: (Town Map)","Outer:","Wood(s)","Center:","Shop(s)","Hospital","Suburb:","Home(s)","School(s)","The final Girl (End Boss)"]},{"l":"Final Version","p":["-> Outer","-> Suburb / Outer","Appartment(s)","Camp(s)","Center:","Farm(s)","Home(s)","Hospital","Mall","Mill(s)","Mine(s)","Next to the Cemitary (Tutorial)","Outer:","Park(s)","Pick your path: (Town Map)","Restorant(s)","School(s)","Shop(s)","Start in the Hounted House (Intro)","Store(s)","Suburb:","The final Girl (End Boss)","Townhall","University","Wood(s)"]}],[{"l":"Graphical Overview"},{"l":"Overview Map","p":["A 2D map showing roads, points of interest, and region indicators. The center of the town is more urban areas, more to the outside it gets rural, and on the outskirts, there may be more abandoned/unused areas. The map is managed as a hexagonal tilemap. This means around 42 tiles to map all possible edges and transitions between types.","Requires all tilesets needed to cover regions, roads, paths, building types, and the surrounding forest."]},{"l":"Expedition Map","p":["As with the town map, the base is a hex map that is more detailed than the town map and has more 2.5D visual aspects. The base textures also need 42 tiles to map all possible edges and transitions between types. Exceptions are that some of the detail or building types may only have edges on top the or bottom of a hex.","Several tilesets are required per type of setting and region on the map.","Ref. Tilemap for hex based grids Note: To reduce the workload layered hard edges can be used where suited. Meaning that an edge tile covers another tile to create the transition. The result is that the top edge tile texture can be used to define multiple transitions without having to manually create all maps."]}],[{"l":"Technical Overview","p":["Two map types get generated procedurally where the town map contains multiple event maps. While there is some overlap there is a split between the required functionality and the visual representation of the underlying information.","When a new game starts the town map is generated and populated with a pseudo-random selection of event nodes. When a play selects an event node on the town map and starts an expedition the map zooms in to the node as the details get generated and drawn onto the screen."]},{"l":"Expedition","p":["The player starts an expedition by selecting the location on the town map."]},{"l":"Preparation","p":["MVP: Skips this phase: The player is presented with the town map and possible expeditions to choose from.","The player uses downtime to move across the map and or gather resources.","High-level object overview:"]},{"l":"Select an Event","p":["In the preperation phase the user is presented with a town map and has a certain amount of time to complete the daily tasks.","For the MVP the only available progress are expedition events."]},{"l":"Shoping Event","p":["TODO Implementm Not part of the MVP"]},{"l":"Reseache Event","p":["TODO Implementm Not part of the MVP"]},{"l":"Expedition Event","p":["Expedition events start by the player hovering the mouse over an event on the town map and then deciding to select the event.
