Nostalgia of older style hardware and presentation is something that has a niche yet devout audience throughout the history of gaming, and I think that if we go the pixel art + Manual route, we can capture that audience."]},{"i":"environment","l":"Environment:","p":["The game takes place in a fictional town within the United States. Most likely a small suburb with a school, some stores, a summer camp, and other amenities, perhaps it even has a few abandoned environments such as a sawmill, or dock.","On October 13 198X, A teenager broke into an abandoned house on a dare from their friends, while exploring, they find a forbidden text and read it, expecting nothing more than a way to pass the time.","Instead, all hell broke loose, many of the town’s inhabitants became possessed by demons, and some even became the willing servants of the devil, aiming to hunt down and kill the teen.","You play as this teenager, one of many slasher tropes, desperately seeking out the resources required to perform the counter ritual and set everything right again, it’s the only way you know you can make it out of this alive.","Also, the girl who you all thought would be the “Final Girl”? She’s nowhere to be seen."]}],[{"l":"Small Town Map","p":["As the player is selecting a character to play a town map is generated for the game."]},{"l":"Game Design"},{"l":"Prepphase","p":["MVP: Skips this phase: The player is presented with the town map and possible expeditions to choose from.","The player uses downtime to move across the map and or gather resources."]},{"l":"Expedition","p":["The player starts an expedition by selecting the location on the town map."]},{"l":"Technical","p":["Two map types get generated procedurally where the town map contains multiple event maps. While there is some overlap there is a split between the required functionality and the visual representation of the underlying information.","When a new game starts the town map is generated and populated with a pseudo-random selection of event nodes. When a play selects an event node on the town map and starts an expedition the map zooms in to the node as the details get generated and drawn onto the screen.","High-level object overview:"]},{"l":"Visual"},{"l":"The Town Map","p":["A 2D map showing roads, points of interest, and region indicators. The center of the town is more urban areas, more to the outside it gets rural, and on the outskirts, there may be more abandoned/unused areas. The map is managed as a hexagonal tilemap. This means around 42 tiles to map all possible edges and transitions between types.","Requires all tilesets needed to cover regions, roads, paths, building types, and the surrounding forest."]},{"l":"Generator Config","p":["Big Map (+-82 Nodes)","Small Map (+-60 Nodes)"]},{"l":"The Expedition Map","p":["As with the town map, the base is a hex map that is more detailed than the town map and has more 2.5D visual aspects. The base textures also need 42 tiles to map all possible edges and transitions between types. Exceptions are that some of the detail or building types may only have edges on top the or bottom of a hex.","Several tilesets are required per type of setting and region on the map.","Ref. Tilemap for hex based grids Note: To reduce the workload layered hard edges can be used where suited. Meaning that an edge tile covers another tile to create the transition. The result is that the top edge tile texture can be used to define multiple transitions without having to manually create all maps."]}]]
