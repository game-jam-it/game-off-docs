## Intro

The game takes place in a fictional town within the United States. A small suburb with a school, some stores, a summer camp, and other amenities, it even has a few abandoned environments such as a sawmill, or dock.

## Setup

At the beginning of every run a map is generated for the player to explore. The town is split up into the three typical region, an urban center, with suburb housing around it, and rural locations outside of those areas.

For every region the town has multiple sectors/nodes for the player to explore. Most of these sctors are random nodes, while some are quest specific nodes that can be substantualy larger.

## Events

Most node on a town map are randomly selected out of a set of event for the region the node is in, while some of them are fully hand crafted others can have randomized elements in them. At the same time some nodes are just prperation nodes used to travel, stock up or learn info, others are expedition nodes where the player has to explore the sector to find items or defeat a specific threath.

Finaly some nodes have both, that may or may-not be available depending on the state of the game.
